# uec cm

The Capacity Management System (CMS) is a single, trustworthy, accurate, official source of the data relating to service/unit capacity across the whole of the NHS in England.

Which then provides this positive change:

Improving the way that the data can be viewed and analysed/disseminated, so that decisions can be made with the knowledge of the current and future status of the capacity of the business

There is an expectation that each file of this repository template is concise and self-documented.

This repo contains the following:
- `docs/adr` Contains the ADR 'decisions'
- `infrastructure/` Contains infrastructure related Terraform templates for deploying the app.
- `scripts/` Various scripts including githooks, functions etc.
- `tests/` Contains tests related to the app

## Architecture

### Diagrams

TODO

### Configuration

Most of the projects are built with customisability and extendability in mind. At a minimum, this can be achieved by implementing service level configuration options and settings. The intention of this section is to show how this can be used. If the system processes data, you could mention here for example how the input is prepared for testing - anonymised, synthetic or live data.

## Contributing

To ensure consistency and turn on the required githooks contributors must run the following script from the project root see below

/bin/bash scripts/git/git-config-set-up.sh

Describe or link templates on how to raise an issue, feature request or make a contribution to the codebase. Reference the other documentation files, like

- Environment setup for contribution, i.e. `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- Coding standards, branching, linting, practices for development and testing
- Release process, versioning, changelog
- Backlog, board, roadmap, ways of working
- High-level requirements, guiding principles, decision records, etc.

## Contacts

Provide a way to contact the owners of this project. It can be a team, an individual or information on the means of getting in touch via active communication channels, e.g. opening a GitHub discussion, raising an issue, etc.
